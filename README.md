# MILKOME

MILKOME is a Mother-infant cohort recruited in Copenhagen, Denmark.

We have sequenced faeces of mothers and infants at three different time points; pre-weaning, early-weaning, and late-weaning. In addtion, faeces were enriched in diverse glycan sources and these consortia were also sequenced.

Following scripts represent how the sequence data were analysed.
